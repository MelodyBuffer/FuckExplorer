# F\*\*k Explorer.exe

This program will ~~kill~~(restart) your explorer.exe since it's such a mother-f\*\*ker component of Windows.

As of the release of this repository, the latest version of Windows 11 still has this issue.

You might not be able to change the audio output source by left-clicking the taskbar. The control panel doesn't pop up, especially after switching from full-screen programs.

Open a file folder, then open Task Manager. Wait for about 1 second for explorer.exe to appear in the list. Right-click it and select 'Restart.' Wait for another second for the restart to complete, and then close Task Manager.

I'm absolutely fed up with having to do this. So here is this tool.
